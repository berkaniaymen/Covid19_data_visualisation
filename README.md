# COVID-19 Excess Deaths and Confirmed Deaths Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 **excess deaths** and **confirmed deaths** across countries, using data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org). It visualizes trends, patterns, and discrepancies between reported COVID-19 deaths and estimated excess mortality.

The project was developed in **Tableau** and explores data using various visualization techniques such as **line charts**, **bar charts**

**Key Columns**:  
1. `Entity` - Country/region name  
2. `Day` - Date of the record  
3. `Cumulative excess deaths per 100,000 people`  
4. `Cumulative excess deaths (95% CI lower bound and upper bound)`  
5. `Total confirmed deaths per 100,000 people`

## Visualizations Created

1. **Line Chart**  
   - Purpose: Track cumulative excess deaths over time for selected countries.  
   - Insight: Trends in excess mortality reveal the long-term impact of the pandemic.  

2. **Bar Chart**  
   - Purpose: Compare total confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people across countries.  
   - Insight: Identify countries with the highest and lowest reported death rates.

4. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Purpose: Compare central estimates of excess deaths to lower and upper confidence bounds.  
   - Insight: Show uncertainty in excess death estimates over time.

5. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - Combines all visualizations into a single dashboard for an intuitive, user-friendly analysis experience.
